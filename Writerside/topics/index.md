## Adverbial Phrase

An adverbial phrase is a group of words that functions as an adverb, modifying a verb, an adjective, or another adverb
in a sentence. Adverbial phrases provide additional information about how, when, where, why, to what extent, or under
what conditions something happens. They can be made up of adverbs along with other words like prepositions, articles,
and nouns.

## Participial Phrase

A participial phrase begins with a present or past participle and includes objects, modifiers, or other complements.
it does not include a subject and a finite verb. Instead, it contains a participle and acts as an adjective to
modify a noun.

## Prepositional Phrase

A prepositional phrase starts with a preposition and includes the object of the preposition (which is usually a noun or
pronoun). Prepositional phrases act as modifiers providing additional information about time, location, direction,
cause, manner, or means.
