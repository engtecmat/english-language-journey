## Adverbial Phrase

An adverbial phrase is a group of words that functions as an adverb, modifying a verb, an adjective, or another adverb
in a sentence. Adverbial phrases provide additional information about how, when, where, why, to what extent, or under
what conditions something happens. They can be made up of adverbs along with other words like prepositions, articles,
and nouns.

## Participial Phrase

A participial phrase begins with a present or past participle and includes objects, modifiers, or other complements.
it does not include a subject and a finite verb. Instead, it contains a participle and acts as an adjective to
modify a noun.

## Prepositional Phrase

A prepositional phrase starts with a preposition and includes the object of the preposition (which is usually a noun or
pronoun). Prepositional phrases act as modifiers providing additional information about time, location, direction,
cause, manner, or means.

## Verb

### Forms

There are seven primary forms of verbs in English including: "base form," "infinitive form," "past form," "past participle," "present participle," "third person form," and "subjunctive form."

The terms "bare infinitive," "base form," "root form," "plain form," and "simple form" all refer to the same form of a verb, which is the verb without any inflection (i.e., without "to" in the case of infinitives, and without suffixes such as -s, -ed, or -ing). In American English, "base form" and "bare infinitive" are the most commonly used terms to refer to the simplest form of a verb. Moreover, "infinitive form" and "full infinitive" refer to the same form (a verb with "to" in front of it).


### Types

Verbs are categorized into two main types: finite and non-finite verbs. Finite verbs show tenses such as past,
present and future, agree with the subject in person and number, and can function as a main verb in an independent
clause. Non-finite verbs do not show tenses by themselves, do not agree with the subject, and cannot fuction as main verb in an
independent caluse. Non-finite verbs include infinitives, gerunds, and participles, which could show tenses with auxiliary
verbs such as _have_ and _be_.
